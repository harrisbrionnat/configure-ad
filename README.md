# How to Install and Deploy Active Directory in the Cloud (Azure)

This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.

## Environments and Technologies Used
- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services

## Operating Systems Used
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

## High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps
- Create a Windows 10 and Windows Server 2022 Virtual Machine in Azure
- Enable Active Directory Domain Services on the Windows Server VM
- Join the Windows 10 client machine to the Domain Controller on the Windows Server VM
- Allow non-administrative users to access Remote Desktop

## Deployment and Configuration Steps

### Creating Our Virtual Machines

1. Set up a Windows Server 2022 virtual machine that will host our domain controller. In the Azure portal, go to **Virtual Machines** → **Create** → **Azure Virtual Machine**.
2. Create a new resource group named `active-directory-rg`. Name the VM `active-directory-dc`. Set the region to West US 2, the image to Windows Server 2022, and the size to Standard_D2s_v3 (2 vCPUs, 8 GiB memory). Choose a username and password, then check the licensing agreement. Go to the networking tab, name the VNet `active-directory-vnet`, and click **Review + Create**.

   </p>
3. Set up a client machine to connect to the domain controller on Windows Server. Again, select **Create** on the Virtual Machines tab, using the same resource group. Name it `active-directory-client`, and set the region to West US 2. Use Windows 10 as the image, and the size as Standard D2s v3 (2 vCPUs, 8 GiB memory). Choose a username and password, check the licensing agreement, and ensure it is in the same network as the Windows Server VM. Click **Review + Create**.
4. Set the Domain Controller's NIC's private IP address to static. Go to the Virtual Machines tab, click on `active-directory-dc`, then go to **Networking** → **Network Settings**. Click on the virtual NIC, then on **ip-config1**. Change the private IP setting from dynamic to static.
5. For testing purposes, disable the Windows Firewall on `active-directory-dc`. Once logged in to the VM, right-click the start menu and select **Run**. Type `wf.msc`, click **Windows Defender Firewall Properties**, and turn off the firewall for the Domain, Private, and Public Profile tabs.

   </p>
6. Set `active-directory-client`'s DNS server to `active-directory-dc`'s private IP address. On `active-directory-client`, go to **Networking** → **Network Settings**. Click on the virtual NIC, then go to **DNS Servers**, choose 'Custom', and enter `active-directory-dc`'s private IP. Log into `active-directory-client` and ping `active-directory-dc`'s private IP address. Restart `active-directory-client` from the Azure Portal. You can run `ipconfig /all` to check if the DNS settings reflect the domain controller's private IP.

   </p>
7. Install Active Directory Domain Services on `active-directory-dc`. Once logged into the VM, go to **Server Manager**, then **Add Roles and Features**. Click next until you reach **Select Server Roles**. Check **Active Directory Domain Services** and then click **Install**.

   </p>
8. Promote `active-directory-dc` to a domain controller. In Server Manager, click the flag in the upper right corner. Select **Promote this server to a domain controller**, create a new forest with the name `sampledomain.com`, and create a password. Click through the prompts and install. The computer should automatically restart.

   </p>

9. Create a domain admin user within the domain controller using the newly created domain user credentials. Your domain login should look like: `DOMAIN\user` followed by your password. To create a domain admin account:
   - Open **Active Directory Users and Computers**.
   - Right-click `mydomain.com` and add two **Organizational Units**: `_EMPLOYEES` and `_ADMINS`.
   - Create a user to put in the `_ADMINS` organizational unit. Right-click the OU and select **New** → **User**.
   - Fill in the user's first name, last name, and domain account name.
   - Add this user to the Domain Admins Security group by right-clicking **Properties** → **Member Of** → **Add**. Enter `Domain Admins`, click **Apply**, then **OK**. Log out and log in as the newly created domain admin.

   </p>

10. Join `active-directory-client` to the domain. Log in to that PC and go to **Start** → **System** → **Rename this PC (Advanced)** → **Computer Name**. Join the domain `mydomain.com`. Verify that `active-directory-client` is part of the domain by logging into the domain controller and navigating to **Active Directory Users and Computers** → `mydomain.com` → **Computers**.

    </p>

11. Login to `active-directory-client` as the domain admin user. Go to **System** → **Remote Desktop** → **User Accounts** → **Select Users that Can Remotely Access this PC**, and add **Domain Users**.
